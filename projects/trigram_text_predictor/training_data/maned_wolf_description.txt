The maned wolf is a unique animal that lives in South America. 
It is not a true wolf or a fox, but a distinct species with its own genus. 
It has red fur, black legs and a black mane that stands up when it is alarmed. 
It is the tallest canid in the world, with long legs that help it see 
over the grasslands where it hunts. It eats fruits, vegetables and small animals, 
and marks its territory with urine that smells like skunk. It communicates with 
loud barks or roar barks, and usually lives alone or in pairs.
